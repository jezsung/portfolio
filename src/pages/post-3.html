      <h1>Splendor, What are Winning Strategies?</h1>
      <h3>What is Splendor?</h3>
      <p>
        Splendor is one of the most well-known board games across the world,
        designed by Marc André and illustrated by Pascal Quidault(Splendor
        (game), n.d., para. 1). It was published in 2014 by Space Cowboys,
        Asmodee(Splendor (game), n.d., para. 1). Splendor can be played by 2-4
        players and the average playtime is about 30 minutes.
      </p>
      <h3>What are the Rules?</h3>
      <p>
        Splendor is consist of 3 Elements–Gems, Cards, and Novel Tiles, and
        players compete with each other to get Cards and Novel Tiles. The
        players can gain Scores whenever they get Cards or Novel Tiles, and the
        player who gains the first 15 Scores wins the game.
      </p>
      <p>Each player can perform one possible Action out of three per turn:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take one or more Gems</li>
        <li>Reserve one Card and take one Gold Gem</li>
        <li>Purchase Card</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Gems are used to purchase Cards. There are 5 different Normal
        Gems–Emerald, Diamond, Sapphire, Onyx, and Ruby–and 1 Special Gem–Gold.
        Players can take 3 different Gems or take 2 Gems with the same color–all
        except for the Gold Gem. Also, players can reserve one Card and take one
        Gold Gem. Players can treat Gold Gem as any other Gem when purchasing
        Cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a player owns the same amount of Gems of the Card that the player
        wants to purchase, the player can return those Gems and purchase that
        Card. Players can use their purchased Cards to count the number of Gems
        they need to return for further purchases. Unlike Gems, purchased Cards
        will not be returned and can be used infinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once a player owns the same amount of Cards of the Novel Tiles, that
        player gets that Novel Tile. Getting Novel Tiles does not consume a
        player’s turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Cards and all Novel Tiles have Scores. The players who own those
        Cards or Novel Tiles get the Scores. If one of the player’s sum of the
        Scores exceeds 15, that player wins the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following table shows the number of Gems per the number of players:

        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        The following table shows the number of Novel Tiles per the number of
        players:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>2 Players</th>
          <th>3 Players</th>
          <th>4 Players</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Novel Tiles</td>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>5</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>What are Winning Strategies?</h3>
      <p>
        To gain many Scores faster than other players, prioritizing the most
        valuable Cards is a must. The valuable Cards are the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cards that require fewer Gems than others</li>
        <li>Cards with the Gem that is mostly required by Novel Tiles</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since Novel Tiles will not be refilled once they are taken by other
        players, the players who own the most Novel Tiles will likely win the
        game. If you purchase Cards with fewer Gems than others, you will have
        more Cards than other players which means the more Cards you get, the
        faster you can get other Cards (Players can purchase Cards with the Gems
        painted on the Cards they own.) The players who own more Cards are
        likely to get the Novel Tiles. In conclusion, purchasing Cards with
        fewer Gems that are required by the Novel Tiles would be the best
        strategy.
