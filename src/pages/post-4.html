      <h1>HTML, CSS, and Javascript: Separation of Concerns?</h1>
      <p>
        Separation of Concerns(SOC) is one of the popular design principles in
        software engineering. The basic idea behind SOC is that there must be
        one thing—one piece of code—for each specific problem. HTML, CSS, and
        Javascript are core components of modern websites. The following shows
        what each of them takes care of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>HTML: Structures elements</li>
        <li>CSS: Styles elements</li>
        <li>Javascript: Adds logic to elements</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At first, HTML, CSS, and Javascript fit well into the idea of SOC.
        Developers would use HTML files for structuring a website, CSS for
        styling, and Javascript for handling dynamic behaviors. But is it really
        the best way of making websites?
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest downside of making websites with HTML, CSS, and Javascript
        is that it decreases cohesiveness. Even if HTML, CSS, and Javascript
        consist of a website, it is impossible to tell which one does which by
        looking at one file. Developers must keep going back and forth to
        multiple files to grab the overall image of the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naming is also a problem. Since the files are separated, referring from
        one file to another is required. Therefore, developers have to think of
        a massive amount of variable names to avoid naming conflict. Coming up
        with good names is getting harder as development goes, it eventually
        becomes the major issue of slowing down the development process.
      </p>
      <img src="../images/react.png" alt="React.js" />
      <p>
        React.js solves this problem by introducing a new syntax called JSX
        which is a combination of HTML and Javascript. Instead of writing HTML
        and Javascript in separate files, React.js allows developers to write
        code in one file in JSX format. How about CSS? React.js does not handle
        CSS natively, but third-party libraries do the job. Styled-components or
        Tailwind make it possible to integrate CSS to JSX files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developers are moving to the latest libraries such as React.js and
        staying away from the old way. Even though HTML, CSS, and Javascript
        were the most chosen method of building websites in the past, React.js
        has become the most popular library now.
