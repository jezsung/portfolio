        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Jaesung and I’m from South Korea. I was born and grew up in
          Seoul. Seoul is the capatial city of South Korea and it's a highly
          populated city. There are lots of places to eat and hang out in Seoul.
          As a child, since a lot of places were within a walking distance, I
          was able go and hang out with my friends without adults.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm an only child and my parents always gave me the most love they
          could do. My family was not financially stable when I was a kid. But
          my parents never missed a chance to give me a diversed experience.
          They took me to a lot of countries and even sent me to Saipan for a
          month to study. The experience from other countries had always been
          invaluable and affected forming of my current personality.

          When I was in the third grade in high school, I had to choose what to
          do after graduation. I was into video games and doing something with
          computers seemed fun to me. So, I started to learn programming. It
          turned out I made the right decision and I have been enjoying
          programming a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          My English has been improved a lot by reading technical documents
          written in English. Thanks to my improved English, I was able to
          access content spoken or written in English on the internet and that
          made me want to live in other countries. I started to research
          possible ways of living in other countries and it seemed Canada to be
          the best option for me. That was what took me to MITT and I’m looking
          forward to meeting new people and improving my English further so that
          I can study and work with no communication problems.

          I’m passionate about software engineering. This is what I usually do
          in my free time and I really love it. I think learning new
          technologies and using them to visualize my ideas is what makes me
          keep loving software engineering.
